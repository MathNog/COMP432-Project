### Title: Neural Networks for Time Seris Forecast

### Description:

The goal of this project is to provide Time Series Forecasting Methdods and compare it's results for different *"time series types"*. By that we mean stationary and non-stationary time series, seasonal and non-seasonal time series.

The base method for comparison will be the ARIMA Model (see *Tsay* **Analysis of Financial Time Series, chapters 1-3**).
The main method for time series forecast will be different **Neural Networks**.

### Repository Organization

This repository is divided into differente directories.

 - code: directory with the jupyter notebooks created for the project
 - ref: bibliography and references used for the project
 - img: images created during the project
 - data: datasets collected and used as input for all methods implemented
